This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Before Getting Started

Thanks for taking the time to reivew this project!

You will not be able to run this project without supplying a GitHub auth token. To make this easy, I created a file called [`env`](https://github.com/joshbg2k/ReactNativeIssueViewerApp/blob/main/env) at the root level of this project. Take these steps to set up your token:

1. Open the file and see the contents `GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token`
2. Replace `your-github-token` with the GitHu btoken value
3. Save and rename the file to .env (Git will then ignore it)

## Addtional notes

- I built and tested using iOS only, not Android
- I created decent test coverage, but it is incomplete.
- If you are not able to build and run the app, you can [watch a short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11k8pxK47TaZ5oZraA8Y_PMshxXKCln2I/view?usp=share_link) to see the main features

Now here's the rest of the default READEME. Thanks again!

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

~~### Android~~ ### Android not tested!

~~```sh~~
~~# Using npm~~
~~npm run android~~

~~# OR using Yarn~~
~~yarn android~~

````~~

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
````

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
